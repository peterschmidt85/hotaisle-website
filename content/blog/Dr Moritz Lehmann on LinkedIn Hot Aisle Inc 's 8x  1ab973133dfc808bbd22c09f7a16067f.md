Description: Hot Aisle Inc.'s 8x AMD MI300X Server Sets a New Performance Benchmark in FluidX3D CFD
Dr. Moritz Lehmann reports that Hot Aisle Inc.'s 8x AMD MI300X server is the fastest machine he has ever tested, achieving 205 GLUPs/s and 23 TB/s VRAM bandwidth in FluidX3D CFD. This system outperforms all competitors, leaving even Nvidia's GH200 and RTX 5090 far behind. With CUDA no longer the performance leader, OpenCL emerges as the key to unlocking AMD’s superior hardware.
FluidX3D is fully OpenCL-compatible, running seamlessly across AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and Apple GPUs. Full benchmarks and source code available on https://github.com/ProjectPhysX/FluidX3D.
Special thanks to Jon Stevens & Clint Armstrong for providing access to Hot Aisle's cutting-edge system!

# Hot Aisle Inc.'s 8x AMD MI300x server is the fastest computer I've ever tested in FluidX3D CFD, achieving a peak LBM performance of 205 GLUPs/s, and a combined VRAM bandwidth of 23 TB/s.

In terms of performance it leaves every other computer I've seen behind in the dust. The RTX 5090 - the fastest consumer GPU in the world - looks like a toy in comparison.

This marks a very fascinating inflection point in GPGPU compute:

CUDA is not the performance leader anymore.
MI300X beats even Nvidia's GH200 94GB. You need a cross-vendor language like

OpenCL to leverage its power. CUDA vendor-lock now only penalizes both developers and users to not be able to use the faster AMD GPUs.
Good thing FluidX3D is written in OpenCL and runs natively on all AMD/Intel/Nvidia/Apple GPUs and CPUs out-of-the-box.
